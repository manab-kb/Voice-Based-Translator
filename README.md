# Voice Based Translator
A voice based translator has been built here. It performs the following operations:

1. *Detects input voice based on a prompt.* 
2. *Converts user voice to text and displays the same.*
3. *Translates the language to a chosen destination language.*
4. *Creates a '.mp3' file, saves it in the same directory as the program and automatically plays the file.* 

### Demo Test Run :
Below is a test run of the code. The users voice is detected, the input speech is converted to text and is translated to a destination language entered in the code.

### Languages Supported :
